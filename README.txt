Notes or comments to the grader:
The included JSON files were used for testing only. To save to a JSON file, please have a JSON file alreadry created or create one through the File Explorer
window which should pop up. Alerts will pop up on incorrect input in various scenes (such as Quiz, start Quiz, and add Question). Some details for question: 
each added question must have at least two answers, one ofwhich is correct, one selected topic (but not more, such as if a radio button is clicked and a 
topic is entered in the topic text field), and question text. To resetthe add question scene if you have clicked a radio button but want to use a new topic,
 please click on the tab again. Also, JSON files and images must be in the same folder as the executable in order to be loaded correctly. 
Saving with and without exit can be done from home or red x in corner. The me.png image is just the image which appears in the top corner of the quiz window itself
and the taskbar.
